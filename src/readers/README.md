# Readers

## Readers I am interested in eventually supporting

### XML BASED (Not sure if any of these are actually useful... will support if a ticket is raised)

- [ ] GML, KML, & KMZ

### OTHERS

- [ ] Images (.png) <https://github.com/pngjs/pngjs/tree/main> (used by grib2)
- [ ] LAZ (LAS is done, but LAZ is incomplete)
