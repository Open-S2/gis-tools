## Readers I am interested in eventually supporting

### XML BASED (Not sure if any of these are actually useful... will support if a ticket is raised)

- [ ] GML, KML, & KMZ

### Easy to implement

- [ ] GeoJSON Sequence <https://github.com/geojson/geojson-text-sequences?tab=readme-ov-file>
- [ ] ESRIJSON
- [ ] TopoJSON

### OTHERS

- [ ] Images (.png) <https://github.com/pngjs/pngjs/tree/main> (used by grib2)
- [ ] LAZ (LAS is done, but LAZ is incomplete)
