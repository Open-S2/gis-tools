# LIST OF TODOs

[ ] - reimagine the point(Index|Cluster|Grid) system, its too slow for javascript (but perfect for lower langauges that have u64 support). Could be that this will never be necessary once Rust is up and running.

[ ] - readers
[ ] - - KML, KMZ, GML [Does any one use it?]
[ ] - - image -> png (for GRIB2 [Does any one use it?])

[ ] - geometry tools (lookup readme in geometry folder)
[ ] - support missing projections in proj4 found in c++ implementation
[ ] - Grib2 has missing templates

[ ] - PROJ5: Completely new rewrite.
[ ] - - Support all projections
[ ] - - GeoTIFF grids
[ ] - - pipeline system

[ ] - translations [BCP-47 language code] [ISO 639-1 language code]

[ ] Tile readers should support a 'lon-lat' lookup where it finds the RGBA or elevation at said lon-lat. Maybe take an input VectorGeometry, so all points will get the Elevation interface injected.

[ ] Hillshading (raster AND vector)

[ ] - GRIB2 WAVES parsing is incomplete

[ ] - TILE GENERATOR: earclip polygons before storing if desired
