# LIST OF TODOs

[ ] - reimagine the point(Index|Cluster) system, its too slow for javascript (but perfect for lower langauges
that have u64 support)
[ ] - bin -> toRasterTiles, & toVectorTiles
[ ] - readers
[ ] - - KML, KMZ, GML, & GPX
[ ] - - LAS/LAZ
[ ] - - image -> png
[ ] - geometry tools (lookup readme in geometry folder)
[ ] - support missing projections in proj4 found in c++ implementation
[ ] - Grib2 has missing templates

[ ] - translations [BCP-47 language code] [ISO 639-1 language code]

[ ] Tile readers should support a 'lon-lat' lookup where it finds the RGBA or elevation at said lon-lat. Maybe take an input VectorGeometry, so all points will get the Elevation interface injected.

[ ] Hillshading (raster AND vector)
